My riff on "The Tay Bridge Disaster" by William McGonagall. This poem is considered to be the worst of his all of his poems. I wanted to see if this version could make it better, especially since the poem(s) generated will be randomized. 

I uploaded the python script, as well as the original .txt file of "Tay Bridge Disaster", in this repository.
